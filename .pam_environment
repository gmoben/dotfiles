# PAM environment file - sets environment variables for PAM sessions
# (login managers, cron jobs, systemd user services, etc.)
#
# NOTE: This file is DEPRECATED in systemd 254+ (Feb 2023)
# Modern systems default user_readenv=0 in pam_env.so, meaning this file
# is not read unless explicitly enabled in /etc/pam.d/* configs.
#
# Kept for compatibility with older systems (e.g., pre-systemd 254 distros,
# Amazon Linux 2) where it may still be read.
#
# On modern systems, persist-auth-agent handles SSH_AUTH_SOCK detection
# and works across both systemd and non-systemd environments.
